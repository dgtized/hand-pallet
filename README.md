# hand-pallet

A pallet tutorial using virtualbox as a provider.

## Usage

This is a work in progress tutorial, thus far it just brings up a
single Debian node in virtualbox, with an admin user so we can ssh
into it.

A lot of this is cribbed from the following places, but I'm trying to
make things work with leiningen 2.1.1, virtualbox 4.2, the pre-release
pallet 0.8 snapshots, and document the process and problems in one
location.

 * https://github.com/tbatchelli/vmfest
 * https://gist.github.com/tbatchelli/867526/raw/2e1238b8ddc7c888403614f0b906cf077380bf15/pallet-vmfest.md

I hope to proceed this tutorial beyond what is listed there, but this
is what I have documented thus far. *WARNING* I am likely cargo
culting in a number of places and am hoping others can explain what
the correct approach is.

Before we proceed go install
[leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen), and install
[virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). I ran this on
an Ubuntu box, so was unable to use the XPCOM interface, thus the
dependency on vboxjws.

I installed VirtualBox previously for Vagrant, so I removed
`~/VirtualBox VMs`, ran `VirtualBox` and removed existing VMs. I had
also previously made use of vmfest, and much of the metadata is stored
in `.vmfest`, so I removed that as well. I don't think this was
necessary but sometimes it's helpful to start with a clean slate.

**IMPORTANT** I had stale networking configuration in
  `~/.VirtualBox/VirtualBox.xml`. So I ran `rm -rf ~/.VirtualBox` to
  fix this. Prior to that I could not execute `lein pallet up` as it
  hung waiting for an IP and then when that failed threw a locking
  exception when it failed to remove the node because it was unable to
  connect.

In a separate shell run

    $ VBoxManage setproperty websrvauthlibrary null # first time only
    $ vboxwebsrv -t0

I started the project for this tutorial by executing;

    $ lein new hand-pallet
    $ cd hand-pallet
    $ lein pallet project-init

This adds our starting [project.clj](project.clj), and
[pallet.clj](pallet.clj) in the root, which I have since modified to
add dependencies for pallet and specify that pallet should use
virtualbox as it's provider by way of vmfest.

**IMPORTANT** The :groups and require reference in pallet.clj explains
  to pallet-lein which group-spec it should adjust by default in `lein
  pallet up`.

At this point you can execute:

    $ lein pallet config

But I updated this config to what is in pallet-config.clj, so:

    $ cp pallet-config.clj ~/.pallet/config.clj

You may need to adjust the :default-network-type,
:default-local-interface, and :default-bridged-interface per the
documentation at
https://github.com/pallet/pallet-vmfest#configuration.

To download a debian vmfest image run:

    $ lein pallet add-vmfest-image \
        https://s3.amazonaws.com/vmfest-images/debian-6.0.2.1-64bit-v0.3.vdi.gz

At this point we can run:

```
$ lein pallet up
19:20:58.238 [operate-13] WARN  clj-ssh.ssh - Permanently added '192.168.56.102' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.

|    :primary-ip | :private-ip |     :hostname | :group-name | :roles |
|----------------+-------------+---------------+-------------+--------|
| 192.168.56.102 |             | hand-pallet-0 | hand-pallet |        |
```

After finding the public IP from the above command, it should be
possible to ssh into the node as the debian-spec in
[core](src/hand_pallet/core.clj) specifies that we add an automated
admin user.

    $ ssh 192.168.56.102

Once we are done, we can destroy the node with:

    $ lein pallet down

Alternatively you can open a repl in the project using `lein repl`, or
your nrepl client of choice and follow along with the code in
[repl](src/hand_pallet/repl.clj) and referencing
[core](src/hand_pallet/core.clj).

## Errors

I encountered a number of errors along the way, some were clearly my
fault but added to my confusion. I will submit bug reports once I'm
certain which projects they are associated with, or that they are
actual bugs. I'm documenting them here in case someone else encounters
them.

### Lein Pallet Help

    $ lein pallet help

Midway though the output I encounter this error:

> version          - Print Pallet's version to standard out.
> vmfest-script failed to load: java.lang.RuntimeException: No such var: compute/compute-service, compiling:(pallet/task/vmfest_script.clj:18)
>
> Run pallet help $TASK for details.

### Lein pallet up

    $ lein pallet up

Just seems to hang and then complains about adjusting locked nodes.
I'm guessing I need to provide a hook for a specific groupspec to
converge, or converge first but I'm confused by this.
