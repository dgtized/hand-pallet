# hand-pallet

A pallet tutorial using virtualbox as a provider.

## Usage

This is a work in progress tutorial, thus far it just brings up a
single Debian node in virtualbox, with an admin user so we can ssh
into it.

A lot of this is cribbed from the following places, but I'm trying to
make things work with leiningen 2.1.1, virtualbox 4.2, the pre-release
pallet 0.8 snapshots, and document the process and problems in one
location.

 * https://github.com/tbatchelli/vmfest
 * https://gist.github.com/tbatchelli/867526/raw/2e1238b8ddc7c888403614f0b906cf077380bf15/pallet-vmfest.md

I hope to proceed this tutorial beyond what is listed there, but this
is what I have documented thus far. *WARNING* I am likely cargo
culting in a number of places and am hoping others can explain what
the correct approach is.

Before proceeding install
[leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen), and
[virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). This was run
on an Ubuntu box, so the XPCOM interface is broken, hence the
dependency on vboxjws.

In a separate shell run

    $ VBoxManage setproperty websrvauthlibrary null # first time only
    $ vboxwebsrv -t0

Take a look at the configuration in [project.clj](project.clj), and
[pallet.clj](pallet.clj) in the project root, as they specify which
dependencies, default provider, image and group to install.

Specify a `~/.pallet/config.clj` using `lein pallet config` to
generate but then copy the one provided in the project from
[pallet-config.clj](pallet-config.clj).

    $ lein pallet config
    $ cp pallet-config.clj ~/.pallet/config.clj

Adjustments to the `:default-network-type`,
`:default-local-interface`, and `:default-bridged-interface` per the
documentation at https://github.com/pallet/pallet-vmfest#configuration
may be required.

To download a debian vmfest image run:

    $ lein pallet add-vmfest-image \
        https://s3.amazonaws.com/vmfest-images/debian-6.0.2.1-64bit-v0.3.vdi.gz

Boot up the vm:

```
$ lein pallet up
19:20:58.238 [operate-13] WARN  clj-ssh.ssh - Permanently added '192.168.56.102' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
|    :primary-ip | :private-ip |     :hostname | :group-name | :roles |
|----------------+-------------+---------------+-------------+--------|
| 192.168.56.102 |             | hand-pallet-0 | hand-pallet |        |
```

After finding the public IP from the above command, ssh into the node.
The `debian-spec` group specification in
[core](src/hand_pallet/core.clj) installs an admin user with matching
username with `automated-admin-user`.

    $ ssh 192.168.56.102

The default vmfest user with password vmfest also works

    $ ssh vmfest@192.168.56.102

Once complete, destroy the vm with:

    $ lein pallet down

Alternatively you can open a repl in the project using `lein repl`, or
your nrepl client of choice and follow along with the code in
[repl](src/hand_pallet/repl.clj) and referencing
[core](src/hand_pallet/core.clj).

## Errors

I encountered a number of errors along the way, some were clearly my
fault but added to my confusion. I will submit bug reports once I'm
certain which projects they are associated with, or that they are
actual bugs. I'm documenting them here in case someone else encounters
them.

### Lein Pallet Help

    $ lein pallet help

Midway though the output I encounter this error:

> version          - Print Pallet's version to standard out.
> vmfest-script failed to load: java.lang.RuntimeException: No such var: compute/compute-service, compiling:(pallet/task/vmfest_script.clj:18)
>
> Run pallet help $TASK for details.

### Lein pallet up hangs

When I first wrote this tutorial I had problems with `lein pallet up`
hanging.

I installed VirtualBox previously for Vagrant, so I removed
`~/VirtualBox VMs`, ran `VirtualBox` and removed existing VMs. I had
also previously made use of vmfest, and much of the metadata is stored
in `.vmfest`, so I removed that as well. I don't think this was
necessary but sometimes it's helpful to start with a clean slate.

**IMPORTANT** However, I did have stale networking configuration in
`~/.VirtualBox/VirtualBox.xml`. So I ran `rm -rf ~/.VirtualBox` to fix
this, and then restarted `vboxwebsrv -t0` after clearing out existing
nodes. Prior to that I could not execute `lein pallet up` as it hung
waiting for an IP. This cascaded into a locking exception when it
failed to remove the node it could not connect to.

## Project initialization

To initialize another project as this one has, the following commands
were executed. The comments explain which files get a default config
from each command.

    $ lein new hand-pallet      # project.clj
    # cd hand-pallet
    $ lein pallet project-init  # pallet.clj
